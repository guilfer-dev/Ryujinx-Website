### Development

We do encourage you talk to some devs in #development (on our Discord) before developing any PRs so we can make sure you aren't conflicting with another dev's plans, and so we can help you get accustomed to our code base and methods.

## Building

To build the website you need:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.x

To start working on the Daemon, you can build the main branch:

1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx-Website.git` or fork it and cd into.
2. Restore project's dependencies : `npm install`
3. Run website with `npm run dev`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

## Contact

If you have contributions, suggestions, need website support or just want to get in touch with the team, join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Ryujinx).

## Donations

If you'd like to support the project financially, Ryujinx has an active Patreon campaign.

All the developers working on the project do so on their free time, but the project has several expenses:
* Hackable Nintendo Switch consoles to reverse-engineer the hardware
* Additional computer hardware for testing purposes (e.g. GPUs to diagnose graphical bugs, etc.)
* Licenses for various software development tools (e.g. Jetbrains, LDN servers, IDA)
* Web hosting and infrastructure maintenance

All funds received through Patreon are considered a donation to support the project. Patrons receive early access to progress reports and exclusive access to developer interviews.
