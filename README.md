### Development

1. Clone the repo: `https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx-Website.git` or fork it and cd into.

All developers working on the project do so in their free time, but the project has several expenses:

- Hackable Nintendo Switch consoles to reverse-engineer the hardware
- Additional computer hardware for testing purposes (e.g. GPUs to diagnose graphical bugs, etc.)
- Licenses for various software development tools (e.g. Jetbrains, IDA)
- Web hosting and infrastructure maintenance (e.g. LDN servers)

All funds received through Patreon are considered a donation to support the project. Patrons receive early access to progress reports and exclusive access to developer interviews.
